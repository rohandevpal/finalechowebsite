    body: "Our journey with ECHO India started 4 years ago in 2016. With the help of ECHO India we were able to inculcate holistic training for TB by involving institutions such as NIMHANS to conduct clinics regarding TB. We have come a long way and see continued growth and potential by using this platform. Having had great success in the capital of Delhi, the program is now being adopted by other states and scaling to PAN India. These clinics are widely appreciated for their knowledge sharing and capacity building efforts and we are delighted to be working with them.",
